## About Me

I'm Jeong Tae-woo, a third-year student at Chonbuk National University's Department of Computer and Artificial Intelligence. 
I am interested in gaming and artificial intelligence. 
Like the field of interest, we are hoping for a career related to game development and artificial intelligence. 
As for development-related project experience, I conducted team projects through Linux programming, mobile programming, and database classes.
